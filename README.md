# MovieFinder
This is a simple app I made during [React](https://react.dev/)/[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) course at [Coders Lab](https://coderslab.pl/pl). It uses Redux for storing data of rated movies (or series). Whenever store is updated data is also saved to local storage so your movies will be remebered even if you close your browser (and you dont have to register an account or anything). 

Movie data is fetched from [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com).
Its built with [Remix](https://remix.run) framework.
